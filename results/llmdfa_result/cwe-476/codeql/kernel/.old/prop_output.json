The variable `x` is assigned the value of `object` at line 6, but since we are considering `object` for `bss_ies`, we need to establish that it hasn't changed its reference during the function execution. Therefore, if `object` is NULL initially, it remains the same before line 15 as it was after line 1. No assignment modifies `object` before line 15; thus the values before line 15 and after line 1 can indeed be the same.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
